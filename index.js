"The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.",

"If life were predictable it would cease to be life, and be without flavor.",
"If you look at what you have in life, you'll always have more. If you look at what you don't have in life, you'll never have enough.",
"If you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will fail above everyone else's success.",
